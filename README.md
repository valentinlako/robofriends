Hey there! This is ROBOFRIENDS

This is my first github project made 100% with React.

The names & emails are requested trough a fake generator API and inserted within the users component
The robot images are random generated trough RoboHash API (https://robohash.org/)

The search field is also a component created to be live, lightning fast, and connected to the users API.

We also have react error catch (componentDidCatch) - in case we don't receive any user data from API call from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users - it will retreive a beautiful error.
